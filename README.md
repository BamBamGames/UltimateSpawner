# UltimateSpawner2D
UltimateSpawner2D is a simple spawn system created for Unity 2D projects

## How to use it

## Features
- Different spawn modes (FixedTime, Progressive, RandomTime, External, Input)
- Built-in pooling system (With easy activation)

## Why UltimateSpawner2D?
It's not like the best spawn system, but I was tired of creating a new spawn system for every new project I started so I created a spawn system with everything I need. With this in mind I hope I don't need to create another spawn system again.
